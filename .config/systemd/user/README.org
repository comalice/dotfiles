# User SystemD Units

## Replace Plasma's default window manager with i3wm.

Unit files:

plasma-i3.service
plasma-kwin-x11.service -> /dev/null

The service execs i3 during Plasma's startup. The soft link to /dev/null prevents Plasma from starting the default window manager. You'll need to `systemctl --user start plasma-i3` before this will work.

## Emacs service file

`systemctl --user start emacs`
